    <i>This is a DRAFT</i>

    <h3>I. Introduction</h3>

    <p> The Gatekeeper module is intended to allow an ACS installation to act
    as a simple gate keeper for another web site.  This is particularly useful
    for dealing with "mounting" another legacy website on our own site, while
    adding a security layer.  We can then only allow access to the legacy website
    from the main ACS server.  

    <h3>II. Vision Statement</h3>

    <p>
    </p>

    <h3>III. System/Application Overview</h3>
    
    <p>
    The ACS gatekeeper package provides an application for managing seamless
    remote viewing of other web pages with optional security layers.
    </p>

    <p>
    The package consists of the following components:
    </p>

    <ul>
    <li>A web interface for retrieving foreign urls.
    <li>An API for adding security restrictions.
    </ul>

    <h3>IV. Use-cases and User Scenarios</h3>

    <p> 
    <ul>
    <li> Jane Webmaster wants to build an ACS site that provides paid
    access to a currently existing web site.  This other site uses
    significantly different technology, so full integration would
    require a great deal of effort.  Instead, Jane creates an instance
    of the gatekeeper package which points to the existing site. She
    sets up a security restriction for the gatekeeper instance using
    ACS permissions by only allowing read access for a newly created
    user group.  She then modifies the ACS Ecommerce system to insert
    and remove users from the new user group based on their
    subscription payments.  Finally, she modifies the existing site to
    only serve requests from her ACS server's IP address.
    </ul>

    <h3>V. Related Links</h3>

    Lots of other web sites do related things.  For example, anonymizer sites allow
    you to surf the web while doing seamless translation of the page.
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.anonymizer.com">Anonymizer Site</a>
    </ul>


    <h3>VI.A Requirements</h3>

    <p><strong>10.0 Seamless Viewing</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    The gatekeeper should provide seamless viewing of url's.  This means
    that the URL's should look like they belong to the ACS site, not the
    original site.
    </p>

    <p><strong>20.0 Restricted Browsing</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    A given instance of the gatekeeper package should only provide access
    to a single site.  The user must not be able to modify the URL so that
    arbitrary sites can be retrieved through the server.
    </p>

    <p><strong>30.0 Link Translation</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    All links from the gatekeeper page to the given site should be
    translated to use the gatekeeper.
    </p>

    <p><strong>40.0 User Tracking</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    The ability to track all pages viewed via the gatekeeper should exist.
    </p>

    <p><strong>50.0 Flexible Restrictions</strong>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><strong>50.1 ACS Permissions</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    The gatekeeper package should support standard ACS permissioning.  Access can thus
    be limited by setting up limited read access to an instance of the gatekeeper package.
    </p>
    <p><strong>50.2 Callbacks </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    The gatekeepers should be provide access control via registered callbacks.
    </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>60.0 Full HTTP Support</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    The gatekeeper should support the entire HTTP specification.
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>60.1 POST Support</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
        POST form submission must be supported.
        </p>
        <p><strong>60.2 Non-HTML Pages</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
        Retrieval of non-HTML pages, such as GIFs and JPEGs, must be supported.
        </p>
        <p><strong>60.3 Cookie Support</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
        The system should have the ability to store and respond with cookies sent
        from the guarded site.
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    </p>
